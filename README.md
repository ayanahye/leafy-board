Leafy Board

This is Leafy Board where you can set new goals for yourself and turn a new leaf in your life. 

The first step is to enter your name to be presented with a personalized header on the homepage. Then, you can clik the plus sign at the bottom of the homepage to create your first ever leafy board!

To set a new goal, all you have to do is press the '+' button and type in a title and goal in the popup! You then also have the option to delete the goal with the x button once the goal has been achieved. 

The board page also allows you to set the background colour with a colour wheel by clicking the 3 lines and pen icon.

Remember, if you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your hopes!
